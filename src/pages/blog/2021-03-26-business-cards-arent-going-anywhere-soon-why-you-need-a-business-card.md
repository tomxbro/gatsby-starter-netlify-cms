In this digital age most things happen in just a click. From online shopping, to operating a business, there are few things that the internet has not made more effective and convenient. And this extends to marketing. It’s natural to want to be able to be able to reach your clients instantly. 

And while digital media have made business dealings more convenient, there are certain cases where digital media simply does not reach your potential customer fast enough. 

In such cases you have to depend on an old tool. That’s right. Sometimes there’s just no replacement for an old fashioned business card. 

Imagine you have met a new client who wants to know about your business. Between the time you first meet, and the time it takes to email them your information, your potential new client will have to wait. And this provides the opportunity for the momentum of your first meeting to wear down. Or worse yet, it gives them time to forget you. 

The problem is that many business owners overlook the use of business cards, thinking that digital marketing is adequate. Nothing could be further from the truth. Here are the primary reasons why always having a business card on hand is a vital component for marketing your services. 

What Is A Business Card? 

A business card is a printed tool in the form of a card which informs the potential clients about the card holder's occupation. The small printed card consists of your name, a logo of your organization, the name of your organization, office address, contact number and email address. These details on the card help your clients identify you and your business. 

Why Having A Business Card Is Imperative For Business Owners?

* Acts as a Powerful Marketing Tool: What do you do when you meet a new client at a business or marketing event? In such busy places you will rarely get time to fully explain  your business details. Instead, make it easy for your potential client to reach you by exchanging business cards. Having a stack of business cards at business conferences and trade shows and then exchanging them with potential clients is a great way to help you build your network.
* Draw Your Client’s Attention At Once: If you do not understand how to initiate conversation with your new client then the business cards can be a great icebreaker. The details on the card will help initiate a virtual conversation by letting your clients know about your business.  
* Win Your Client’s Confidence: When a client invests in your business he or she would like to know if your business has a reputation in the business world. This is another place where your business cards can help. A business card adds a touch of professionalism which will help win your clients' confidence and trust with ease. 
* Expand Your Business Networking Circles: The printed paper rectangular card is still considered the fastest medium for sharing your business information with prospective clients in this digital era. Handing out the card to the people helps expand the circle of your business network and can open up new business opportunities.
